# Hello, friend...
Paraphrasing Mr. Feynman, if you can't explain it simply, you don't really get it. So here are some attempts at explanations.

  2. TryHackMe Writeups
  3. HackTheBox Writeups
  4. OverTheWire Writeups
  5. CryptoHack Writeups
  6. [Unitec Assignments](https://github.com/Lona44/write-ups/tree/main/Unitec%20Assignments)




Other things I want to write about in the future:
  1. Argon2
  2. Deep Reinforcement Learning for Cybersecurity
  3. ELK/EFK stack
  4. Splunk
  5. Docker
  6. Kubernetes
  7. Bug Hunting Automation
