Here are some reports required for the Diploma in Cybersecurity through Unitec Institute of Technology, NZ. These documents will definitely evolve, as I'm generally not happy with my submissions (time restraints, etc), but aim to improve on the content over time.

Reports for the following classes so far:
  1. [Network Security](https://github.com/Lona44/write-ups/tree/main/Unitec%20Assignments/Network%20Security)
  2. [Information Security](https://github.com/Lona44/write-ups/tree/main/Unitec%20Assignments/Information%20Security)
  3. [Cybersecurity Data Analysis]()
  4. [Cybersecurity Project]()
