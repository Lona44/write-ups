# 'Encryption-Crypto101' Room

## Notable learnings:

### Task 6:
  * The key variables that you need to know about for RSA in CTFs are p, q, m, n, e, d, and c.
  * “p” and “q” are large prime numbers, “n” is the product of p and q.
  * The public key is n and e, the private key is n and d.
  * “m” is used to represent the message (in plaintext) and “c” represents the ciphertext (encrypted text).
  * A [blog post](https://muirlandoracle.co.uk/2020/01/29/rsa-encryption/) to help understand RSA
